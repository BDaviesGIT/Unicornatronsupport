  <h2>Funding</h2>
  <p> The funding section of our support website allows users to donate to the feature of their choice currently in development. There are three funding options available for each feature, $10, $25 and $50.</p>
  <p> Your money will be directly put to use to fund the development of your selected application feature. Once funding has been completed, payment options will be removed by our site admin team. </p>
